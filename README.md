# Xgboost-Imbalanced-Time-Series-Project
This project implements a complete, production-ready workflow for building and optimizing an XGBoost-based classifier on a highly imbalanced time-series dataset. It focuses on advanced feature engineering, rigorous model evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization suitable for real-world anomaly detection or financial/sensor analytics tasks.
